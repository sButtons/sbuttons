# Contributing

If you have a new button style you would like to add or any fixes you want to contribute, be sure to follow this guideline.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Important Notes

1. Issues that have the label `first-timers-only` is made for beginners who have contributed to less than 5 repositories. This is a way to help people who are new to open source and contributing.
2. Before contributing to an issue, make sure that no one is assigned or has taken that issue. If no one is and you would like to work on the issue, please comment on the issue to let others know that someone is working on the issue.
3. Before creating a pull request, it is **important** that you make sure your branch and repository is up to date with this one. Some conflicts can be resolved, but many are hard to resolve. **Add the upstream** branch and always keep your branch up to date.

# Instructions

1. Fork the repository.

2. To make changes to the existing buttons, or add new ones, all changes should be made in `src/sbuttons.less`.
   1. If you're adding a new button type similar to basic, hover, etc..., create a file in `src/components` with the name preceeded by `_`. For example: `_basic.less`. Remember to include the file when you're done in `src/sbuttons.less`.
   2. If you're adding a new button to an existing type (for example: animated), create a file in `src/components/<type_name>` with the name preceeded by `_`. For example: `_arrow.less`. Remember to include the file when you're done in `src/components/<type_name>`.
   
   **Please follow the convention in naming button classes: `new-class-btn` where new-class is the button name. For example, for hover button it's `hover-btn`.**

    After making any changes, you need to compile the LESS file into CSS. To do that there you can use the following:

    1. Start command:
        ```
        npm start
        ```
        This will run sbuttons on a lite server as well as update the CSS in `dist/sbuttons.css` as you make changes.
    2. Compile command:
        ```
        npm run compile
        ```
    Make sure to run `npm install` before any of these commands.
3. To make changes to the website:
   1. To add new examples, make changes in `assets/js/buttons-examples.js`.
      1. To add new button colors, add them to the variable `buttonColors`
      2. To add new button types, add them to the variable `buttons`. It should follow the following format:
         ```
         {
            type,                  //type of button. Will be used for the id of the section

            label,                 //the title of the button section, which will also be shown in the sidebar menu

            classes,               //the default classes of this section. For example, for basic buttons it's "basic-btn"

            children,              //optional. If the type has subtypes, add them here in an array. The subtypes should
                                   //also follow this same type format

            text,                  //the text to show on the button. If this is omitted, the default text will be Button

            variations,            //this is for button types that don't use buttonColors or don't have normal and rounded
                                   // button styling. Look at social buttons for example on how to use this
            shouldHaveRoundedType, //indicates if rounded button type should hidden or not, defaults to true
            shouldHaveBlockType,   //indicates if block button type should hidden or not, defaults to true
         }
         ```
    3. To edit the HTML, make changes in `index.html`
    4. To edit the CSS of the website, make changes in `assets/css/`
    5. To edit the JS of the website, make changes in `assets/js`
