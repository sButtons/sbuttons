# Contributing

If you have a new button style you would like to add or any fixes you want to contribute, be sure to follow this guideline.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

# Instructions

1. Fork the repository.

2. To make changes to the existing buttons, or add new ones, all changes should be made in `src/sbuttons.less`.
   1. If you're adding a new button type similar to basic, hover, etc..., create a file in `src/components` with the name preceeded by `_`. For example: `_basic.less`. Remember to include the file when you're done in `src/sbuttons.less`.
   2. If you're adding a new button to an existing type (for example: animated), create a file in `src/components/<type_name>` with the name preceeded by `_`. For example: `_arrow.less`. Remember to include the file when you're done in `src/components/<type_name>`.

    After making any changes, you need to compile the LESS file into CSS. To do that there you can use the following:

    1. Watch command:
        ```
        npm run watch
        ```
        This will update the CSS in `dist/sbuttons.css` and `dist/sbuttons.min.css` as you make changes. Make sure that if you use watch, you use `npm run prettier` before committing the code.
    2. Compile command:
        ```
        npm run compile
        ```
3. To add more examples to the website:
    1. To edit the HTML, make changes in `index.html`
    2. To edit the CSS of the website, make changes in `assets/css/`
    3. To edit the JS of the website, make changes in `assets/js`

## Create Pull Request

1. Create a new branch:
   ```
   git branch new-branch
   ```
2. Checkout new branch:
   ```
   git checkout new-branch
   ```
3. Add, commit and push your changes to the new branch
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "changes"
   git push origin new-branch
   ```
4. To make sure your forked repository is up to date with this repository. Add this repository as the upstream repository by doing the following:
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/shahednasser/sbuttons.git

```
Then, to fetch from this repository:
```
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master master
```
5. Go to your forked repository and press the “New pull request” button.
6. Once the pull request is reviewed and approved, it will be merged.

### Note on abandoned pull requests

If a pull request is left unchanged for a week after changes are requested and the issue was assigned to the person that sent the new pull request, they will be unassigned and someone else will be given the chance to work on it.
